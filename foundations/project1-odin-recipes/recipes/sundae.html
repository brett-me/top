                    <h3>Steps</h3>
                    <ol class="text-box">
                        <li>
                            To make the ice cream, mix 1 can of condensed milk,
                            vanilla and salt in a bowl. Whip the cream until
                            stiff peaks form.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Add a few spoons of whipped cream to the condensed
                            milk and fold in gently to lighten the mixture. Pour
                            the lightened condensed milk back into the remaining
                            whipped cream and gently fold in.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Pour this mixture into a plastic freezer-friendly
                            container or and freeze for 2 hours.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            To make the chocolate-fudge sauce, the other can of
                            condence milk, evaporated milk, and chocolate, in a
                            saucepan over a low heat, stirring continuously,
                            until all the chocolate bits have melted. Add the
                            cashews.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Once the chocolate has melted, allow the mixture to
                            boil gently, stirring continuously. Once small
                            bubbles start forming, take it off the heat and set
                            aside to cool.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Once the ice cream is semi-set (after the two hours
                            in the freezer) swirl in about 2 cups of the
                            chocolate-fudge sauce and the cashews. Be careful
                            not to overmix. Return to the freezer for another 8
                            hours.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Serve with some of the remaining chocolate-fudge
                            sauce poured on top. Decorate with cherries.
                        </li>
