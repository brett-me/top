        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>
                To make the ice cream, mix 1 can of condensed milk, vanilla<br />
                and salt in a bowl. Whip the cream until stiff peaks form.
            </li>
            <li>
                Add a few spoons of whipped cream to the condensed milk and<br />
                fold in gently to lighten the mixture. Pour the lightened<br />
                condensed milk back into the remaining whipped cream and<br />
                gently fold in.
            </li>
            <li>
                Pour this mixture into a plastic freezer-friendly container
                or<br />
                and freeze for 2 hours.
            </li>
            <li>
                To make the chocolate-fudge sauce, the other can of condence<br />
                milk, evaporated milk, and chocolate, in a saucepan over a<br />
                low heat, stirring continuously, until all the chocolate<br />
                bits have melted. Add the cashews.
            </li>
            <li>
                Once the chocolate has melted, allow the mixture to boil<br />
                gently, stirring continuously. Once small bubbles start<br />
                forming, take it off the heat and set aside to cool.
            </li>
            <li>
                Once the ice cream is semi-set (after the two hours in the<br />
                freezer) swirl in about 2 cups of the chocolate-fudge sauce<br />
                and the cashews. Be careful not to overmix. Return to the<br />
                freezer for another 8 hours.
            </li>
            <li>
                Serve with some of the remaining chocolate-fudge sauce poured<br />
                on top. Decorate with cherries.
            </li>
