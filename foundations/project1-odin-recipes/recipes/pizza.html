                    <h3>Steps</h3>
                    <ol class="text-box">
                        <li>reheat the oven to 230Â°C.</li>
                        <li>
                            Add the sugar and crumble the fresh yeast into warm
                            water.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Allow the mixture to stand for 10-15 minutes in a
                            warm place until froth develops on the surface.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Sift the flour and salt into a large mixing bowl,
                            make a well in the middle and pour in the yeast
                            mixture and olive oil.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Lightly flour your hands, and slowly mix the
                            ingredients together until they bind.
                        </li>
                        <li>Generously dust your surface with flour.</li>
                        <li>
                            Throw down the dough and begin kneading for 10
                            minutes until smooth, silky and soft.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Place in a lightly oiled bowl and cover with cling
                            film or a towel. Leave to rest until soft to the
                            touch, but not too springy - about 15 mins.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            On a well floured surface, evenly roll each piece
                            with a rolling pin to make a round, thin pizza base.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Place on a lightly oiled, non-stick baking tray (we
                            used a round one, but any shape will do!)
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Spread the passata on top making sure you almost go
                            to the edge.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Evenly place the mozzarella (or other cheese) on top
                            and season with the oregano and black pepper then
                            drizzle with a little olive oil.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Cook in the oven for 10 - 12 miutes until the cheese
                            slightly colours. When ready, place the basil leaf
                            on top.
                        </li>
