            <li>1 tsp of sugar</li>
            <li>15g fresh yeast</li>
            <li>225g of plain flour</li>
            <li>1 and 1/2 tsp of salt</li>
            <li>2 tbsp extra virgin olive oil</li>
            <li>80g of tomato passata</li>
            <li>70g mozzarella</li>
            <li>Pinch of oregano</li>
            <li>1 Basil leaf</li>
            <li>Black pepper</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>reheat the oven to 230Â°C.</li>
            <li>Add the sugar and crumble the fresh yeast into warm water.</li>
            <li>
                Allow the mixture to stand for 10-15 minutes in a warm place
                <br />
                (we find a windowsill on a sunny day works best) until froth
                <br />
                develops on the surface.
            </li>
            <li>
                Sift the flour and salt into a large mixing bowl, make a well
                <br />
                in the middle and pour in the yeast mixture and olive oil.
            </li>
            <li>
                Lightly flour your hands, and slowly mix the ingredients <br />
                together until they bind.
            </li>
            <li>Generously dust your surface with flour.</li>
            <li>
                Throw down the dough and begin kneading for 10 minutes until<br />
                smooth, silky and soft.
            </li>
            <li>
                Place in a lightly oiled bowl and cover with cling film or a<br />
                towel. Leave to rest until soft to the touch, but not too<br />
                springy - about 15 mins.
            </li>
            <li>
                On a well floured surface, evenly roll each piece with a<br />
                rolling pin to make a round, thin pizza base.
            </li>
            <li>
                Place on a lightly oiled, non-stick baking tray (we used a<br />
                round one, but any shape will do!)
            </li>
            <li>
                Spread the passata on top making sure you almost go to the<br />
                edge.
            </li>
            <li>
                Evenly place the mozzarella (or other cheese) on top and<br />
                season with the oregano and black pepper then drizzle with a<br />
                little olive oil.
            </li>
            <li>
                Cook in the oven for 10 - 12 miutes until the cheese slightly<br />
                colours. When ready, place the basil leaf on top.
            </li>
        </ol>
